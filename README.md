## entropy

Notes and code related to algorithmic information theory.  Under construction.

Thus far, this repository contains:

- Notes from EE376A, Information Theory,  (Prof. Tsachy Weissman).
- "The principle of maximum entropy," an article I wrote as part of the Stanford math department's Directed Reading Program.  Advised by Yuval Wigderson.
- "Information-theoretic trust," a research note on how information-theoretic tools can be used to quantify trust in AI systems.
